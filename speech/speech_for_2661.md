# 2661. [First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/description/)

Fellow coding enthusiasts, I stand before you today to elucidate the intricacies of a most fascinating algorithmic challenge: the quest to find the first complete index in a matrix painting problem. Let us embark on this intellectual journey together, exploring the depths of efficient problem-solving and the art of code optimization.

## The Problem at Hand

Picture, if you will, a matrix of numbers, each unique, each waiting to be painted. Alongside this matrix, we have an array, a sequence of numbers that dictates the order in which we shall apply our metaphorical brush strokes. Our mission, should we choose to accept it, is to determine at which point in this painting process we first complete either a row or a column of our matrix canvas.

## The Naive Approach

In our initial foray into this problem, we might be tempted to take a more... shall we say, brute force approach. We could, for instance, maintain sets of rows and columns, checking after each brush stroke whether we've completed our masterpiece. But oh, the inefficiency! The redundancy! Surely, we can do better.

## The Optimized Solution

And indeed, we can. Allow me to present a solution that is not just functional, but elegant in its efficiency:

```python
class Solution:
    def firstCompleteIndex(self, arr: List[int], mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        row_count = [0] * m
        col_count = [0] * n
        value_to_position = {mat[i][j]: (i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n)}
        
        for index, value in enumerate(arr):
            if value in value_to_position:
                i, j = value_to_position[value]
                row_count[i] += 1
                col_count[j] += 1
                
                if row_count[i] == n or col_count[j] == m:
                    return index
        
        return 0
```

## The Brilliance Unveiled

Let us dissect this code, layer by layer, to truly appreciate its brilliance.

### Preprocessing: The Foundation of Efficiency

We begin by laying a solid foundation. Instead of repeatedly searching our matrix, we create a lookup table, a dictionary if you will, mapping each value to its position in the matrix. This, my friends, is the key to unlocking O(1) access time for each element.

### Counting: The Art of Keeping Score

Two arrays, `row_count` and `col_count`, become our scorekeepers. With each brush stroke, we increment the corresponding row and column counts. No longer do we need to perform costly set operations; a simple increment suffices.

### Early Termination: The Power of Knowing When to Stop

As soon as a row or column count reaches its maximum, we know our task is complete. This early termination saves us from unnecessary iterations, a testament to the power of strategic thinking in algorithm design.

### Simplified Logic: The Beauty of Clarity

Gone are the nested loops and complex set operations of our naive approach. In their place, we have a streamlined process, as clear and refreshing as a mountain stream.

## The Efficiency Gained

This optimized solution boasts a time complexity of O(m*n + k), where m and n are the dimensions of our matrix, and k is the length of our painting sequence. The space complexity stands at O(m*n) for our lookup table and O(m+n) for our count arrays.

But numbers alone do not tell the whole story. This solution shines in its ability to:
- Avoid repeated set operations, those silent performance killers
- Utilize direct indexing, a far cry from the cumbersome searching of sets
- Terminate at the earliest possible moment, without a single wasted operation

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my dear audience, what we have witnessed here today is not merely an optimization of code, but a triumph of logical thinking and algorithmic finesse. We have transformed a problem of painting into a symphony of efficiency, a ballet of bits and bytes that dances across our computational stage with grace and precision.

Let this serve as an inspiration to us all. In the face of complexity, let us seek simplicity. In the chaos of inefficiency, let us find order. And in the vast landscape of possible solutions, let us always strive for that perfect balance of clarity, efficiency, and elegance.

Thank you, and may your code always compile on the first try.
